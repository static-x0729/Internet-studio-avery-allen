<h2>Semester Project Summary </h2>
<p class="Summary">I am slightly changing the content for my summester project. My original plan was to create a website that allows both beginner and experienced artists to share or learn other methods of creating art. It would be a community-based platform where people could upload their artistic process and share it with others, or someone could be looking to learn a new medium or artstyle so they would search for a tutorial to follow on my website. However, I realized that making an upload feature might be too difficult for me at this point in my knowledge of coding, so I have decided to condense my idea into a simpler framework. My new plan is for the website to have pre-loaded tutorials on the site that are step-by-step with images followed by a transcript. The user will still be able to search through a list of art mediums like painting, drawing, or sculpture. From there, they can filter what specific style they want to learn, and then there would be 3 different "levels" for each style: Beginner, Intermediate, and Experienced. This is sort of a "test your skill" type of system, where beginners can start from the basics and work their way up, while the pros can choose more advanced tutorials. I plan to give each medium 3 or 4 different styles to give the sense that there is variety. I will also do research on what specific styles are most commonly practiced/sought after by artist so that I can put them in my website.</p>
	
	<h1>Six Thinking Hats:</h1>

<h3 class="White-hat">White Hat</h3>

<p>The information that I have for my project is the idea: the problem, the solutions, the website layout, and the website content. The information that I need is what forms of art are likely to be studied, and what art styles are popular amongst learners. I can get this information from research and polls from fellow artists, beginners, and friends.</p>

<h3 class="Red-hat">Red Hat</h3>

<p>I want to slightly alter my idea for this project. Instead of making a community-based platform where anyone can upload their personal art techniques and routines, I will put certain art tutorials based on what is most searched or most popular with the general art community. There will be a smaller variety of styles and media than I initially planned. I am scared that my original idea is too complex and time-consuming, so I am slightly altering the idea. I am excited to execute my idea, but I just worry that the result will not look like what I had hoped for while in the planning stages.</p>

<h3 class="Black-hat">Black Hat</h3>

<p>What doesn’t fit in with my project is the scale of content I had planned to implement on the website. The problem is that I had too large an idea, so I need to condense it. Potential problems I could run into are not finding accurate data for my website. A possible downside of my project is the content, but hopefully it works out.</p>

<h3 class="Yellow-hat">Yellow Hat</h3>

<p>This new idea might work because it still achieves the goal of providing a space for artists to learn AND improve their skills. To make this work, I must appeal to artists of every skill level, while still having a variety of tutorials for everyone to explore. I can make this more attractive to users by using content that is highly sought out by artists.</p>

<p>Other alternatives for this project could include video tutorials or written instructions along with photos of each tutorial. I am still doing research for the project, but I will add to this list once I discover other alternate solutions. 

<h3 class="Blue-hat">Blue Hat</h3> 

<p>The subject is art, specifically art tutorials and improving artistic skills. The goal is to create a platform for artists of all skill ranges to learn other forms and styles of art at any skill level. To keep my project on track, I will keep the project goals in mind and continue to ask myself, “Does this align with the project?” I will also take notes on my research, test the alternatives, and rework my solutions when problems occur.</p>

<h2>Semester Project Summary </h2>
<p class="Summary">I am slightly changing the content for my summester project.</p>
	
	<h1>Six Thinking Hats:</h1>

<h3 class="White-hat">White Hat</h3>

<p>The information that I have for my project is the idea: the problem, the solutions, the website layout, and the website content. The information that I need is what forms of art are likely to be studied, and what art styles are popular amongst learners. I can get this information from research and polls from fellow artists, beginners, and friends.</p>

<h3 class="Red-hat">Red Hat</h3>

<p>I want to slightly alter my idea for this project. Instead of making a community-based platform where anyone can upload their personal art techniques and routines, I will put certain art tutorials based on what is most searched or most popular with the general art community. There will be a smaller variety of styles and media than I initially planned. I am scared that my original idea is too complex and time-consuming, so I am slightly altering the idea. I am excited to execute my idea, but I just worry that the result will not look like what I had hoped for while in the planning stages.</p>

<h3 class="Black-hat">Black Hat</h3>

<p>What doesn’t fit in with my project is the scale of content I had planned to implement on the website. The problem is that I had too large an idea, so I need to condense it. Potential problems I could run into are not finding accurate data for my website. A possible downside of my project is the content, but hopefully it works out.</p>

<h3 class="Yellow-hat">Yellow Hat</h3>

<p>This new idea might work because it still achieves the goal of providing a space for artists to learn AND improve their skills. To make this work, I must appeal to artists of every skill level, while still having a variety of tutorials for everyone to explore. I can make this more attractive to users by using content that is highly sought out by artists.</p>

<h3 class="Green-hat">Green Hat</h3>

<p>Other alternatives for this project could include video tutorials or written instructions along with photos of each tutorial. I am still doing research for the project, but I will add to this list once I discover other alternate solutions. 

<h3 class="Blue-hat">Blue Hat</h3> 

<p>The subject is art, specifically art tutorials and improving artistic skills. The goal is to create a platform for artists of all skill ranges to learn other forms and styles of art at any skill level. To keep my project on track, I will keep the project goals in mind and continue to ask myself, “Does this align with the project?” I will also take notes on my research, test the alternatives, and rework my solutions when problems occur.</p>

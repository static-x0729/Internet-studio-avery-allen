	<p>Three things I learned from the readings:</p>
 <ul>
<li> I didn't know that the Internet was categorized into three phases (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)</li>
<li>I foudn it interesting that each era of the internet had unique characteristic thats built upon the previous era. For example, how the 2000s was the rise of CSS and HTML standards, and generally less limited than in the 90s.</li>

	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
	<p>Three things I learned from the readings:</p>
 <ul>
<li> I didn't know that the Internet was categorized into three phases (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)</li>
<li>I foudn it interesting that each era of the internet had unique characteristic thats built upon the previous era. For example, how the 2000s was the rise of CSS and HTML standards, and generally less limited than in the 90s.</li>
<li>I didn't know that phone apps are designed with the same framework and coding as websites on the internet. I always assumed it was slightly different but that makes me think it would be easy to design an app if I have the same skills to make a website.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Part 3: Semester Project</h2>
<p>The problem? A beginner artist wants to learn a new  form of art or wants to mimic the style of another artist, but doesnt know where to start or what materials they should use. The solution? A website that has video and slideshow turorials from artists that want to share their artistic process. The artist would also upload pictures and links to where the similar materials can be bought.</p>

	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
	<p>Three things I learned from the readings:</p>
 <ul>
<li> I didn't know that the Internet was categorized into three phases (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)</li>
<li>I foudn it interesting that each era of the internet had unique characteristic thats built upon the previous era. For example, how the 2000s was the rise of CSS and HTML standards, and generally less limited than in the 90s.</li>
<li>I didn't know that phone apps are designed with the same framework and coding as websites on the internet. I always assumed it was slightly different but that makes me think it would be easy to design an app if I have the same skills to make a website.</li>
 </ul>

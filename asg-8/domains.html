	<h1>Assignment 8: Domain Names</h1>
<br>
	<p>I was not able to attend class and discuss my domain name with a classmate, but I was able to brainstorm a few ideas based on the subject of my project. Since my idea for the project is to make a website where artists can look for tutorials on a variety of art mediums and styles, the plan is to make a layered site where each catergory of art branches out into specific styles, and then different tutorials based on beginner, intermediate, and professional. I want the domain name to reference this layered aspect, so I came up with a few ideas: Artis-Tree, StyleFindr, and Branch Out.</p>

<br>
<h2>3 Possible Doman Names:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>ArtisTree</li>
	<li>StyleFindr</li>
	<li>Branch Out</li>
</ol>
<br>
	<p>Out of all three domain names, I'm leaning most towards Branch Out or ArtisTree because those two best represent the Idea for my webpage. Branch Out is very obvous for what I'm trying to convey, but ArtisTree has a bit of wordplay. It is meant to be Artistry but the "Tree" suffix represents the branch idea as well. I think I'll go with Branch Out.</p>

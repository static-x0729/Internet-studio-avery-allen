<h1>Design Statement</h1>
 <p>
      For this project, I chose Raccoon City as my destination because I have always enjoyed the Resident Evil video game series. The city itself has a unique blend of mystery, nostalgia, and dark atmosphere that inspired my design approach. I wanted the website to capture that same feeling by using a combination of muted colors, strong contrast, and clean, readable text. The typeface I selected is a modern sans-serif font for legibility, paired with bold headers that reflect strength and structure, much like the architecture seen throughout the series. Text placement was centered and balanced to make navigation feel natural and comfortable for the viewer, without overcrowding any section.
    </p>

    <p>
      The color palette features reds, greens, and light neutrals to create contrast while reflecting the city’s industrial tone. Red symbolizes danger and energy, echoing Raccoon City’s history and the Umbrella Corporation’s iconic branding. The army green complements it by grounding the design with an earthy tone. Buttons were designed to be bold and eye-catching, with rounded edges and smooth hover animations to make interaction feel dynamic but still approachable. Their central placement on each page encourages exploration and helps users intuitively move between sections like “Things to Do” and “Places to Eat.”

      Images were selected to immerse the viewer in the world of Raccoon City without relying on overt horror elements. This visual consistency strengthens the overall user experience and helps the fictional location feel cohesive and believable. By combining subtle references to the Resident Evil universe with thoughtful design choices to simulate a real destination website, I was able to create a site that both represents my interest in the series and demonstrates a strong understanding of interaction design.

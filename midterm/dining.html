    <h2>Emmy’s Diner</h2>
    <p>
      A local favorite since the early 1990s, Emmy’s Diner is known for its nostalgic atmosphere, chrome counters, and hearty comfort food that has kept Raccoon City residents coming back for decades. Emmy herself is a longtime Raccoon City native, and her diner is one of the few places that still feels like home in the midst of the city’s eerie quiet.

      The menu features classics like the Umbrella Burger, a double patty topped with spicy crimson sauce, alongside homemade fries, milkshakes, and breakfast platters served all day. Locals recommend the Midnight Melt, a grilled sandwich that pairs perfectly with Emmy’s signature coffee blend. It’s the perfect stop before heading out on a night patrol or escaping the occasional zombie sighting.

      The chef’s menu changes weekly, featuring elegant dishes like Crimson Salmon, Herb-Crusted Filet, and Moonlit Tiramisu. The cocktail bar is also well-known for its signature drink, the G-Virus Glow, a luminescent blue martini that’s almost too pretty to drink.

  <figcaption><strong>Discover the Raccoon City Orphanage</strong></figcaption>
  <p>Nestled on the north side of the city, the Raccoon City Orphanage was once a charitable institution. Founded prior to 1997, the orphanage quietly functioned as a front for Umbrella Corporation’s experimental bioweapons research, with children raised on-site, educated in-house, and sometimes transported via underground tunnels to the nearby NEST facility. Today, visitors are drawn to the site’s haunting ruins: boarded-up wards, hidden passages, and traces of the past echoing in the abandoned classrooms. A guided “Haunted History” walk offers a sobering look at the city’s secret underbelly and stands as a reminder of how beneath the city’s pleasant façade, something far more sinister once operated.

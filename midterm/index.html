	<h1>Welcome To Raccoon City</h1>
	<p>Nestled in the Arklay Mountains, Raccoon City was once a thriving industrial and cultural hub in the American Midwest. Founded in the late 19th century, this picturesque city became known for its blend of small-town charm and modern innovation. By the 1990s, Raccoon City had blossomed into a center for cutting-edge biotechnology research, attracting engineers, businessmen, and researchers alike. Today, Raccoon City stands as a fascinating destination for those drawn to both history and mystery. Visitors can explore historic landmarks like the Spencer Mansion Estate, stroll through Downtown Raccoon’s scenic streets lined with art deco architecture, or unwind in the lush trails of the Arklay Forest.</p>

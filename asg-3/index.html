	<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
	<h2>Part 2:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I found this website <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/18-years-of-buro">awwwards.com</a> where most of the clickable elements are hard to navigate because so many of them are clickable without you realizing it.</li>
	<br>
		<li>By framing a project as a story, you can refine your ideas by treating it like a narrative with characters, a setting, conflict, climax, and resolution. This approach makes you think about how everything fits together, including not just features but also motivations, emotions, obstacles, and outcomes. For example, developing characters and scenarios helps you connect with users and clarify what is most important to them. This process sharpens your priorities and focuses on what is necessary instead of what is just flashy. A story can help identify the goal. The narrative structure shows what the experience will feel like over time, what it does, and how it behaves, leading to more meaningful and memorable user experiences.</li>
	<br>
		<li>Some different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design are by: using Colors to catch the reader's attention, Style (such as italics or quotations) to emphasize it compared to the surrounding text, and Contrast to combine or contrast typefaces to create a visual hierarchy. Example: <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a></li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Part 3: Creative Brief</h2>
 <h3>Project: "Artistry Hub"</h3>
 <p>My objective is to create a website where artists can share video tutorials of their art process and art materials, no matter the medium or artstyle.</p>
 <p>The Problem:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>An artist, either beginner or experienced in a different medium, wants to learn a new form of art or wants to mimic the style of another artist, but doesnt know where to start or what materials they should use. This problem would be solved with my website.</li>
     </ul>
 <p>Audience:</p> 
 <ul>
 	<li>The target audience are people who create art as a hobby, or as a profession, and don't have the means to take professional classes or go to art school.</li>
 </ul> 
 <p>Competition:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>The greatest competiton for my project is  <a href="https://blog.society6.com/top-ten-best-sites-learn-new-art-skills-review/">Society6 Blog</a>, because this platform has a strong community that shares art with each other, but my projects has the advantage of adding tutorials and not just sharing art.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key message to my target audience is that my website would encourage growth and improvement. It would encourage artists to try new things, be bold, take risks. But most importantly to have fun. I want my website to build a community.</p>  
<p>Call to Action:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Join us in building a vibrant online community where artists of every style and medium can inspire, teach, and learn from each other. Share your creative process, showcase your favorite tools, and connect with fellow artists around the world!‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>To measure success for my project, I will keep my goal clear and try not to stray too far from it. A successful website will have a community of active users. In order to keep track of the activity, I'd monitor the analytics of my website: user feedback, and take those into account when improving my website to make sure my project is having a positive impact.</p>

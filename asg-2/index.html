<h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?
	<br>
How do they work together?
    <br>
Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li> Structured Content is infomration that is broken into individual components that are organized and connected to each other. Semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags that desribe the meaning and purpose of that information to the browser and algorithm. 
	<li> Structured content creates the resuable data, and semantic html describes the relationship and structure of that data to help people and machines understand them.
	<li> Both structures content and semantic HTML make content accessible and accurate for smart software agents, like search engines, so your information works well beyond just the webpage.
</ul>

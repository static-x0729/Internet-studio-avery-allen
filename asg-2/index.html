<h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?
	<br>
How do they work together?
    <br>
Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li> Structured Content is infomration that is broken into individual components that are organized and connected to each other. Semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags that desribe the meaning and purpose of that information to the browser and algorithm. 
	<li> Structured content creates the resuable data, and semantic html describes the relationship and structure of that data to help people and machines understand them.
	<li> Both structures content and semantic HTML make content accessible and accurate for smart software agents, like search engines, so your information works well beyond just the webpage.
</ul>

	<li> Based on the article by Denise Jacobs, the technique that I would consider the most effective for me would be the “bait-and-switch” tactic. When I'm stuck, I often hit a wall before I even begin because i am a huge perfectionist. Telling myself "I'm just getting it set up" feels low-pressure enough to bypass that inner roadblock. From experience, once I'm settled into work, I get drawn into actual progress. This tactic helps me bypasses the little critic inside my head by reframing the task in a lighter way. I pair that with “go for ‘good’” tactic. I'm not striving for perfect, but for progress. In practice, this dual approach helps me get through the initial dread and into a productive flow that often surprises me in how smoothly it leads to real results.
	<li> A countermeasure from the video I found was to think about your choices for your future self and your current self. Even if you make good choices now, your future self may fall back into old habits. The solution is to trick your future self by making calenders or setting deadlines to feel more productive. Personally, making a planner/schedule helps me organize what I have to do, and when i need to get it done by.

<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Why Taylor Swift is my Least favorite Singer</h2>
<img src="images/swifty.jpg">

<p>Taylor Swift is overrated. Most of her songs are about past relationships that barely lasted long enough to be considered a "relationship". Her music is bland, lyrics empty. She's a rich white woman who would rather fly in her private jet than drive 5 minutes to the nearest Walmart. And her fanbase tries way too hard to make her seem likeable, but instead they end up harrassing people who give her the smallest criticisms.</p>

<h2>Artists who are better than Taylor Swift:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Kali Uchis</li>
	<li>Clairo</li>
	<li>Summer Walker</li>
</ul>

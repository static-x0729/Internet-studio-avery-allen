    <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
      <p>
        My ideal job is to be an Illustrator or Graphic Designer. I would prefer if my career would allow me to combine visual creativity with digital design tools. I enjoy graphic design because it lets me communicate ideas through color, typography, and composition. Illustration allows me to design characters or concepts, which I frequently enjoy. A job that blends art, storytelling, and design problem-solving would be the perfect fit for my skills and long-term goals.

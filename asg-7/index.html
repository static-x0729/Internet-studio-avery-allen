	<p>Jill Valentine would make the perfect running mate to Ada Wong because she complements Ada’s cunning with unwavering loyalty, bravery, and tactical brilliance.</p>
	<p>While Ada operates in the shadows, Jill thrives in direct action, fearless under pressure and always ready to protect those who can’t protect themselves. Her background as a S.T.A.R.S. officer and experience surviving countless bioterror threats give her the strength and moral center that balance Ada’s secretive, strategic nature. Together, they’d form an unstoppable duo: Ada as the calculating queen pulling the strings, and Jill as the fearless commander ensuring order is maintained.</p>

<p>Ada Wong is the pseudonym of an enigmatic unnamed spy of Asian-American descent. She has gained notoriety in the corporate world for being able to handle serious situations and the most difficult requests without guilt. Wong has acted secretly in the background of many biohazard incidents and collected information which became useful to several organisations, while at the same time operating to undermine them. However, Wong follows only her own "true purpose" and has often betrayed the organisations and customers she is affiliated with to achieve it.</p>

<p>I believe that Ada is a good canidate because she actively betrays evil corporations after woriking for them to extract valuable information from them. This absolute diva is great at deception, manipuation, data collection, and she can fight off a hoard of zombies in heels! Ada Wong should be queen of the world because no one embodies power, mystery, and style quite like she does. Ada moves through chaos with elegance and precision, outsmarting everyone while never breaking a sweat. She’s the definition of a diva:cool, confident, and untouchable> She turns danger into an art form. Her sharp intelligence and moral ambiguity make her both unpredictable and fascinating, driven by her own goals rather than anyone else’s agenda. In a world that needs both brains and beauty in command, Ada Wong reigns supreme.</p>

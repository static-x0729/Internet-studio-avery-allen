<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<p>Sketching is fast, flexible, and free from distractions. Designers can quickly explore ideas without worrying about tools, templates, or technical constraints. It allows easy switching between high- and low-level concepts on the same page and focuses attention on structure and functionality rather than visual details.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<p>However, sketching lacks many benefits of digital tools. it’s non-interactive, low fidelity, and offers no version control or collaboration features. Changes are tedious, elements can be inconsistent, and sketches can’t easily be shared or reused in other software. As a result, designers often need to duplicate their work later in digital form.</p>
	

<p>For my project, I would use Wirefeaming Software and Graphic Design Software to make mid-fidelity wireframes of my website. I think that making a digital wireframe that is orgasnized and clean will help me better visualize the structure of my website. Digital wireframing allows for quick adjustments and collaboration while maintaining enough structure to visualize layout and functionality clearly. Using a wireframing tool like Figma would be easier to experiment with different interface ideas, text layouts, and buttons. Unlike sketching, digital wireframes can be easily edited, reused, and refined into higher fidelity versions as the design progresses. This balance of flexibility and precision makes digital wireframing ideal for efficiently developing and communicating design concepts throughout the project.</p>
